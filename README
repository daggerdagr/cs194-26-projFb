TO RUN SIMPLE, PRESET SCENARIOS
    uncomment at least 1 of the functions in main.py

    some functions have the following parameters:
        bumpSatBool
            to bump up the saturation in the photo, make it more miniatures-looking
        usePresetBlurMaskBool
            set to True if you want to use preset gradient/soft mask
            set to False if you want to create your own gradient/soft mask
        usePresetObjMaskBool
            set to True if you want to use preset complex object mask
            set to False if you want to create your own complex object mask
        printMask
            set to True if you want to print out the masks as they get made
            set to False if not

        IMPORTANT: creating your own mask involves inputting your own coordinates using ginput. make sure ginput works. to stop inputting coordinates, you either have to press escape or close the window -- one of those. it works in pycharm so hopefully it works in other formats... (otherwise just use the preset masks. sorry :[ )

miniature.py
    contains all the main logic, including:

    for creating a mask:
        createPolygon()
            create a mask of a polygon from the given coordinates (assuming order)

        getGradientMask()
            create a "soft-polygon" mask from the given coordinates. works with lines (you just input 2 coordinates) and polygons (2+ coordinates)

        generateMask()
            just combines the two above

    for applying the mask and blur together:

        maskedBlur()

    for bumping the saturation:

        bumpSaturation()

outputMake.py

    despite its name, it's for making gauss stacks

utils.py

    custom image-making utilities. it's for my use, mainly.
